- First player to get 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!
- If the board fills up without a winner, it's a draw.

### For Player vs AI:
- The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, so it will never lose if it plays optimally.
- You can play as 'X' and challenge an unbeatable computer opponent.
